        <p>
          FlipRSS helps you to supercharge your <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">
            Mailchimp</a> RSS email campaigns by personalising your content for each
          subscriber and automating its delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add feeds for each content topic and let subscribers select which
          they would like to receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          FlipRSS takes care of automatically retrieving new content from
          your feeds, and sending each subscriber just the content they care
          about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Campaigns can be scheduled automatically or you can send them
          manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personalisation means your email campaigns will have much higher open
          rates, and you have happier and more engaged newsletter subscribers.
        </p>
        <p>
          FlipRSS brings a new level of personalisation and automation to
          RSS-to-email.

        <a id="what-are-rss-feeds"><h3>What is RSS and what are RSS feeds?</h3></a>
        <p>
          RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an internet standard developed
          to provide computer-readable updates about changes to web page
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid having to frequently check your favourite sites for new
          content, RSS provides the ability for site users to subscribe and
          be notified of new content when it is published by the author.
        </p>
        <p>
          RSS is a popular way for sites to share content with viewers and
          RSS feeds can be read by aggregators and other services, like
          FlipRSS.

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          To use FlipRSS you need <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">
            Mailchimp</a> account.
        </p>
        <a id="fliprss-mailchimp"><h3>Connecting FlipRSS to your Mailchimp account</h3></a>
        <p>
          Sign up to FlipRSS in seconds using your existing Mailchimp
          account. This is secure and convenient option recommended by
          Mailchimp for integrations and third party services.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key benefit of signing in with your Mailchimp account is that
          FlipRSS will be automatically pre-populate your campaign set up with templates and
          audiences from your Mailchimp account.

        <a id="creating-mailchimp-audience"><h3>Creating and selecting an audience</h3></a>
        <p>
          Select the audience for your campaign from the dropdown in the <strong>To</strong> panel of your campaign settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create a new audience, click <strong>New Audience</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lists are refreshed automatically when you log in. If for some reason an audience list from your Mailchimp account does not show, you can
          refresh your lists manually by clicking the <strong>Refresh</strong> button next to the audience dropdown.
        </p>
        <p>
          FlipRSS does not hold your audience members' details - they remain in
          your Mailchimp account. FlipRSS only uses the audience dropdown to
          specify which list to use when the campaign is sent.
        </p>

        <a id="creating-mailchimp-groups"><h3>Creating groups for your audience</h3></a>
        <p>
          Delivering customised content to subscribers is a core feature of
          FlipRSS. Adding Groups to your Mailchimp audience allows your
          subscribers to choose and receive only the content they want.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more information on groups, read Mailchimp's <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/getting-started-with-groups/">getting started with groups</a>
          which explains what they are, how they work and how to add use them in your audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enable subscribers to choose only the content they are most interested in and customise your newsletters for each individual, you will need to create a group for each RSS feed within Mailchimp. We can then match your content to an interest group specified by your subscribers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have created your groups in Mailchimp, they will appear
          in the <strong>Show to</strong> dropdown in the <strong>Feeds</strong> panel of your FlipRSS campaign. You can choose which group a
          specific feed is shown to, or choose for a feed to be shown to all subscribers if you want to make sure everyone receive content on a particular topic or from a specific channel.
        </p>
        <a id="enabling-test-sending"><h3>Enabling Test Sending</h3></a>
        <p>
          To ensure you content looks how you expect, enable <strong>Test Sending</strong>
          to allow you to send a single email to the address used by your Mailchimp account.
        </p>
        <p>
          FlipRSS adds this email address to the current audience and tags
          it with <code>fliprsstest</code>. Click <strong>Send Test</strong> 
          to send the campaign only to members with this tag which, by
          default, is your email address.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add the <code>fliprsstest</code> tag to additional subscribers in your list to also include them in test sends.

          Successful email campaigns engage subscribers by making the
          content relevant and personal to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This requires clear and relevant Subject and Preview text, and
          formatting the <strong>From name</strong> to be something they
          will recognise and engage with.
        </p>
        <a id="writing-subject-lines"><h3>Writing a good Subject line</h3></a>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Keep subject lines to the point, personal, and make what you say
          engaging and relevant. It's likely to be the first thing they see
          when your email drops in to their inbox and will determine whether
          they open it or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mailchimp have a <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/best-practices-for-email-subject-lines/">
            useful article</a> about writing good a subject line for campaigns that includes tips
          and best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          To further personalise your email you can use Mailchimp merge tags
          within your Subject and Preview lines to include the subscriber's
          name, the date, or some other relevant information.
        </p>
        <a id="adding-preview-text"><h3>Adding Preview text</h3></a>
        <p>
          Preview text appears in some email clients immediately after the
          subject line. It allows you to reveal more information about the
          contents of the email and can be effective at increasing open
          rates.
        </p>

        <a id="use-verified-email"><h3>Use a verified email address</h3></a>
        <p>
          Mailchimp only sends campaigns from domains that you have verified
          via their Domains page. FlipRSS will only allow you to enter an
          address that belongs to one of your validated domains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ensure <strong>From email</strong> belongs to a verified domain in
          your Mailchimp account. See <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/verify-a-domain/">Verifying a domain in Mailchimp</a>
          for more information.

        <p>
          Click on the Feeds panel in your FlipRSS campaign and add the URL of the content you want
          to include in your email.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can add as many feeds as your FlipRSS plan allows, and the settings of each feed can be tailored for the output you want.
          By tweaking the RSS feed settings you can customise whether it shows for all subscribers or just to a specific audience group. You can change how many items should be included from the feed, whether it should only include new posts since the last email send and even the layout of the posts.
        </p>
        <p>
          RSS feed urls are verified and added to the campaign
          automatically. If the url is to a webpage, FlipRSS will search for
          RSS feeds and add the first it finds. If it can't find an RSS feed or the feed provided isn't valid it will show an error message.
        </p>
        <a id="rss-feed-options"><h3>RSS Feed Options</h3></a>
        <p>
          After adding an RSS feed, you can edit its title, specify the
          maximum number of posts to display, and set the audience group it
          should be sent to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Preferences allow you to set whether the feed should include new items only,

          previous campaigns.

        <p>
          Design your own template using Mailchimp's Classic template
          builder and select Code Your Own.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enable FlipRSS to insert the campaign content in the correct
          location, the template must have <code>mc:edit="fliprss_content"</code>, to the element you want
          the content to appear within.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, you can add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> inside the main
          container cell:
        </p>
        
        <pre>
          <code>
`&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div mc:edit="fliprss_content"&gt; 
    &lt;!--- FlipRSS will insert content here ---&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;`

        <a id="mailchimp-template"><h3>Using a Mailchimp "Drag-and-Drop" Template</h3></a>
        <p>
          Mailchimp's drag-and-drop template builder is useful for quickly
          creating an attractive template but requires some additional steps
          for FlipRSS to use it.
        </p>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Design the template with the Mailchimp drag-and-drop editor as
            normal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you are happy, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to
            the right of the template and click “Export as HTML”.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the downloaded file in a text editor add the FlipRSS 
            <code>mc:edit="fliprss_content"</code> attribute to the element
            in your template where you want content to appear.
            <p>
              Note: The attribute should only be added to 
              <strong>one</strong> element in your template.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Save the file and upload it to your Mailchimp account by
            clicking <strong>Create Template</strong>, then 
            <strong>Import HTML</strong>. Select the file from your computer
            and give your template a name.
          </li>
          <li>
            Back in FlipRSS, click the <strong>Refresh</strong> button to
            reload your templates and select it from the dropdown list.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <a id="styling-feed-content"><h3>Styling RSS feed content</h3></a>
        <p>
          Control the layout for individual feeds by setting its 
          <a href="#layout-options">Layout Options</a>.
        </p>
        <a id="customise-rss-feed-block"><h3>Customise feed block styles</h3></a>
        <p>
          Basic styles for each layout option can be customised using the 
          <strong>Customise Block Styles</strong> panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          This allows basic customisation of the font size, line height,
          padding, font style and colour of all main elements of each feed
          block.
        </p>
        <p>
          Styles are applied to the feed content when it is inserted into
          your template and will override any styles set in your Mailchimp template
          CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more advanced styling, you can edit the template in Mailchimp
          and add your own CSS to customise the appearance of the main
          template area and target specific elements in the feed blocks.
        </p>
        <div className="bg-indigo-50 rounded-md p-6">
          <h4>Enterprise Option</h4>
          <p>
            Enterprise FlipRSS subscribers can use the <strong>Custom</strong> 
            template editor which enables full customisation of the template
            used to render the feed content.
          </p>
          <p>
            This allows you to create a fully-customised layout and match
            the look and feel of your brand to fully control the appearance
            of your campaign.

        <h3 id="testing-campaigns">Test a campaign</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Test Send</strong> feature enables you to preview the
          final campaign email content without sending it to your entire
          list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Test Send creates a member with your email address in your
          Mailchimp audience with a <code>fliprsstest</code> tag which is
          used to send the campaign just to you when you click “Send Test”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a campaign is fully configured, a <strong>Send Test</strong> 
          button will appear in the top-right of the campaign screen. This
          will send your campaign to members/subscribers with this tag. If
          you want other testers to be included add <code>fliprsstest</code> 
          as a tag to any subscriber in your Mailchimp audience.
        </p>
        <p className="p-6 bg-indigo-50 rounded-md">
          Feeds with <strong>New items only</strong> selected will not cause
          FlipRSS to update the date of the last sent campaign. This allows
          you to send any number of test campaigns (for example when working
          on your template design) without it preventing new feed content
          from appearing in your live campaign.
        </p>
        <a id="choose-schedule"><h3>Choose a delivery schedule</h3></a>
        <p>
          FlipRSS supports both scheduled and manual sending schedules and
          dispatches the campaign to Mailchimp for delivery for the selected
          audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the <strong>Sending</strong> panel of the campaign, select
          either <strong>Manual</strong>, or one of the recurring schedule
          options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Campaigns default to <strong>Manual</strong> and can be sent
          immediately and at any time by clicking <strong>Send</strong> in
          the top-right of campaign view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, choose either a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly
          recurring schedule and FlipRSS will send it automatically. Once
          you've selected a schedule, click <strong>Save</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If using a schedule, FlipRSS will send at the scheduled date and
          time until the campaign is changed or deleted.

          FlipRSS has a range of plans to suit your needs so you can select the

        </h3></a>
        <p>
          If a campaign is scheduled for a date and time in the future, it
          will send at that time even if it has already been sent that same
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a campaign that is scheduled to send every Friday at 9am
          is updated at 10am (after it has been sent), to a new schedule for
          17:00 each Friday, it will be sent again at 17:00 on the same day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            If you want to change the time of future schedules, wait until
